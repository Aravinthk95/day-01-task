OBJECTS AND ITS INTERNAL REPRESENTATION IN JAVASCRIPT

     In simple terms.  A javascript object is a collection of named values having state and behavior (properties and method).
     For example: Person, car, pen, bike, personal computer, washing machine etc.
Let takes the case of car. 

     All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car.  All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed at different times.
Let’s have an example of my favorite merc car and list out out its properties(Features):

MAKE: mercedes 
MODEL: c-class
COLOR: white
FUEL: diesel
WEIGHT: 850kg
MILEAGE: 8kmpl
RATING: 4.5

Taking the above as reference, I’ll stress up on objects ,objects properties and methods.

 1)OBJECTS:
     The following code assigns a SIMPLE VALUE (MERCEDES) to a VARIABLE named car:
Var car = “merecedes”;

Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values. 

The following code assigns many values (MERCEDES, C-CLASS, white and soo on ) to a variable named car;

Var car = {make: “mercedes”, Model: “C-Class”, color: “white”,  Fuel: “diesel”, Weight: “850kg”, mileage: “8kmpl”, rating: 4.5};

The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).

SYNTAX:
      Var <object-name> = {key1: value1, key2: value2, keyn: valuen};



2)OBJECT PROPERTIES

     The name : values [aors (in javascript objects ) are called properties.

Var car = { Make : “mercedes”, model : “c-class”, color: “white”, fuel: “diesel”, weight: “850kg”, mileage: “8kmpl”, rating: 4.5};


From the above snoppet, lets have a look what falls under property and property value:


          Property                                     property value

         Make                                                       mercedes
         Model                                                      c-class
          Color                                                      white
          Fuel                                                        diesel
          Weight                                                    850kg
          Mileage                                                    8kmpl
          Rating                                                       4.5

The object properties can be different primitive values, other objects and functions.

Properties can usually be changed added and deleted, but some are read only.

THE SYNTAX FOR ADDING A PROPERTY TO AN OBJECT IS:

ObjectName.objectproperty = propertyValue;

THE SYNTAX FOR DELETING A PROPERTY FROM AN OBJECT IS:

Delete objectName.objectproperty;


THE SYNTAX TO ACCESS A PROPERTY ROM AN OBJECT IS:

objectName.property       //car.make
          //or
objectName[“property”]     //car[“make”]


         //or

objectName[expression]     //x= “Make” ; Car[x]



                                                                                                                                              
3) OBJECT METHODS

     An object method is an object property containing a function definition.

Lets assume to  start the car there will be a mechanical functionality.

  Function( ){return ignition.on}
  
And so similar is to stop/brake/headlights ON & OFF etc.

(Im just trying to roll a picture in your mind. The car will not start / stop by means of code.  I assume you’d get it).

You can also look into many examples & operations here.
So, conclusion and simple definition for java script object methods is “Methids are actions that can be performed on objects”.
